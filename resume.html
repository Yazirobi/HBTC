As a seasoned graphic designer with a solid foundation of four years of professional experience gained a decade ago, I bring a wealth of knowledge and a deep passion for visual storytelling to the table. During my initial years in the industry I honed my skills in branding, web design and print media.
Although I took a career hiatus I have remained engaged with the design community, keeping abreast of the latest trends and advancements in design technology. I am now eager to return to the professional sphere, bringing my rich experience, refined skills, and fresh perspective to new challenges.
